# Asus-TUF-FX504GE-OpenCore

This is the files and configuration for setting up the ASUS TUF FX504GE laptop using OpenCore. I assume no responsibility from use of the files.

Few things about the files
I use the Hackintosh primarily for work. So I don't have much free time to tinker and optimize. But this first commit is pretty much ready to go reliably. You're going to lose some battery life too (no worries if you're on AC). I am going to write more information in the near future though.

**Things to watch for**
- Do not forget to generate your own MLB, Serial Number, and UUID.

**Limitations**
- Wifi not working (currently using the one that came with the laptop. Not planning to switch).
- Bluetooth not working (same as wifi).
- Trackpad not working (in progress. Using a USB mouse for now).
- ASUS Fn Keys (in progress).
- After shutdown process, the laptop will hang. Need to use power button to force turning off. It's fine though for now.
